wget -O install-nethunter-termux hdtps://offse.ec/2MceZWr
```

```bash
chmod +x install-nethunter-termux
```

```bash
./install-nethunter-termux
```

After installation completes:
```bash
nethunter
```

---

### Step 3 – Fix Kali Base System
```bash
sudo apt update
```

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install -y
```

```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

### Step 4 – Install Desktop Environment & Audio Components
```bash
sudo apt install -y \
kali-desktop-xfce \
kali-win-key \
dbus-x11 \
pulseaudio pulseaudio-utils alsa-utils \
pavucontrol \
chromium
```

---

### Step 5 – Chromium Audio Fix (Essential)
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
```

```bash
nano ~/.local/bin/chromium
```

**Paste this content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1
exec /usr/bin/chromium \
  --disable-features=AudioServiceSandbox \
  --no-sandbox "$@"
```

**Save, then:**

```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/chromium
```

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### Step 6 – Start Audio Server (Termux Only)
```bash
pulseaudio --kill || true
```

```bash
pulseaudio --start \
  --exit-idle-time=-1 \
  --load="module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1 auth-anonymous=1"
```

**⚠️ Important:** Do not close the Termux app after running this command.

---

### Step 7 – Configure Kali Audio Settings
Inside Kali environment:

```bash
echo 'export PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Note:** If you see "User-configured server at 127.0.0.1, refusing to start" - this is correct behavior.

---

### Step 8 – Test Audio Functionality
```bash
paplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

If you hear sound playback - the setup is successful!

---

### Step 9 – Create Easy Start Script (Termux)
```bash
nano ~/start-nethunter-kex.sh
```

**Paste this content:**
```bash
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash

echo "[+] Starting PulseAudio"
pulseaudio --kill 2>/dev/null
pulseaudio --start \
  --exit-idle-time=-1 \
  --load="module-native-protocol-tcp auth-ip-acl=127.0.0.1 auth-anonymous=1"

sleep 2

echo "[+] Starting NetHunter KeX"
nethunter -r "export PULSE_SERVER=127.0.0.1 && kex start"
```

**Save, then:**

```bash
chmod +x ~/start-nethunter-kex.sh
```

---

### Step 10 – Create Easy Stop Script (Termux)
```bash
nano ~/stop-nethunter-kex.sh
```

**Paste this content:**
```bash
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
